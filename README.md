# Gift-Wrapping-Algorithm
A visualization of the "Gift-Wrapping-Algorithm"

This algorithm is used to find the convex hull of a given set of points. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that can contain
the set of points. 
You can download the release folder and run the exe to check it out.
